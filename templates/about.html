        <p class="about-text">
            This Movie Recommendation System was built as a demonstration of applying
            <strong>Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing</strong> to real-world
            entertainment data.
        </p>

        <p class="about-text">
            I developed this project to showcase my ability to design <strong>end-to-end ML pipelines</strong> â€”
            from raw data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model building, to deploying a
            production-ready <strong>Flask web application</strong> with dynamic movie posters powered by TMDB API.
        </p>
        <p class="about-text">Key techniques used:</p>
        <ul class="about-text">
            <li>Data preprocessing with <strong>Pandas</strong> and <strong>NumPy</strong></li>
            <li>Feature extraction using <strong>NLTK</strong> (stemming, tokenization)</li>
            <li>Cosine similarity-based recommendation engine</li>
            <li>Backend API with <strong>Flask</strong></li>
            <li>Dynamic movie posters via <strong>TMDB API</strong></li>
            <li>Frontend templates with <strong>Jinja, HTML, CSS</strong></li>
        </ul>

            ðŸš€ My motivation: To demonstrate how AI/ML can personalize entertainment,
            while also proving my capability in <strong>building deployable ML solutions</strong>
            â€” a skill I aim to bring into real-world projects.
